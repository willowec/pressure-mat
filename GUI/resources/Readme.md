# PMI System Resources

This directory contains assorted scripts and resources used by the GUI for communicating with the PMI, and developers for collecting and plotting data from the PMI.

### averaged_calibration_curves.npy

[averaged_calibration_curves.npy](averaged_calibration_curves.npy) is a numpy array containing calibration curves to be loaded by the GUI program. The file is generated by [generate_cal_curves.py](generate_cal_curves.py).

### default_calibration_curves.npy

[default_calibration_curves.npy](default_calibration_curves.npy) is a numpy array containing calibration curves to be loaded by the GUI program. The file is generated by [generate_cal_curves.py](generate_cal_curves.py).

### calibrate_individual_sensor.py

[calibrate_individual_sensor.py](calibrate_individual_sensor.py) is a CLI tool for getting calibration data from a small number of sensors on the mat manually. This tool did not end up being used in the final version of the project.

### get_mat_data.py

[get_mat_data.py](get_mat_data.py) is a CLI tool used for collecting raw data from the PMI.

### generate_cal_curves.py

[generate_cal_curves.py](generate_cal_curves.py) generates caibration curves for the GUI based on data collected by [get_mat_data.py](get_mat_data.py).


### plot_readings.py

[plot_readings.py](plot_readings.py) produces various useful plots from the data collected by [get_mat_data.py](get_mat_data.py).

### test_matspeed.py

[test_matspeed.py](test_matspeed.py) tests the speed at which the PMI can collect and transmit data when the GUI is not slowing it down.
